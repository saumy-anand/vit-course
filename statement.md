Problem Statement
The core problem this project addresses is the lack of structure and insight in managing personal finances. Individuals often struggle to maintain a clear, continuous record of their spending and earning activities, making it difficult to answer fundamental financial questions, such as:

Where is most of my money going?

Are my monthly expenses increasing or decreasing over time?

What is my true cash flow?

The current system aims to solve this by providing a simple, persistent, and analytical tool to transform raw transaction data into actionable financial insights.

🔎 Scope of the Project
The scope of the Modular Expense Analyzer is defined as follows:

Inclusions:

Data Management: Storing and retrieving transactions (Date, Category, Amount) from a local CSV file (persistence).

Data Capture: Handling manual entry of both expenses (negative amounts) and income (positive amounts).

Core Analysis: Calculating aggregate spending by category and deriving key descriptive statistics (mean, median, total).

Time-Series Analysis: Calculating and comparing monthly income and expense totals (resampling).

Reporting: Presenting results through formatted console output and two graphical visualizations (Bar Chart, Line Chart).

Currency: Operations are standardized to Rupees (Rs).

Exclusions (Out of Scope):

Integration with bank accounts or other external APIs.

Advanced features like budgeting, forecasting, or setting spending limits.

Graphical User Interface (GUI); the project is strictly a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application.

Multi-user support or complex authentication.

🧑‍💻 Target Users
The primary target users for the Modular Expense Analyzer are individuals who need a basic, reliable tool for personal financial tracking:

Individuals: Anyone looking to gain better control and understanding of their personal monthly cash flow.

Students/Beginners: Users who are new to tracking finances and require a simple, free, and straightforward command-line utility rather than complex, full-featured software.

Developers/Data Enthusiasts: Users who prefer to keep their data local in a simple format (CSV) and appreciate the use of Pandas and Matplotlib for direct data analysis.
